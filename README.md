# Didgy

This repo is essentially a dumping ground for stuff related to the Digirule 2U.

The digirule 2U is an 8-bit computer integrated into a ruler-shaped PCB and
inspired by the classic Altair 8800.

Unlike the Altair though, it has a lot of limits, such as only having 256 bytes
of RAM, it's essentially a cool little toy.

Anyway, included in this repo are various tools for working with the device
and some sample code and fiddles, see my AltairExperiments repo too to get
an idea.

Hackers rejoice!

Regarding the license, assume everything is GPL v3.0 - this is for compatibility with the upstream code written by Brad Slattery.
